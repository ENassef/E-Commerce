Vite 6
Basically, I recommend waiting for official support, and in the meantime, create your project with Vite 6. Vite 7 has only been out for a day.

Scaffolding your first Vite project - Vite Docs
npm create vite@6
Vite Latest

{
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^7",
    "tailwindcss": "^4",
    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "@tailwindcss/vite": {
      "vite": "^7.0.0"
    }
  }
}
Then install it:

npm install
